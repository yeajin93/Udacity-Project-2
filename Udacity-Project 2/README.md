## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development

I used javascript to build a navigation bar and made the page scroll to a specific section upon link click. There were some alterations to the HTML and CSS Files, but most work is done through the Javascript file.

## Completion

This project has been enhanced with the addition of the navigation bar, which is built dynamically as an unordered list. When you are scrolling through the page, you will see which section you are viewing in the navigation bar. When you click a section in the navigation bar, you will be taken to that specific section on the page.
